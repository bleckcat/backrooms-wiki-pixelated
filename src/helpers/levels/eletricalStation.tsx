        <p>
          Level 3, also referred to as "The Electrical Station", is an expansive
          complex of attenuated brick hallways with electrical machinery
          scattered throughout. Similarly to Level 0, the layout of Level 3
          appears to be randomly segmented, shifting and warping in many
          directions, most of which being illogical in appearance. One constant
          that is seemingly universally maintained throughout Level 3 is the
          piping that lines the walls and ceilings of the strange labyrinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Level 3's configuration seems to be much more diversified than that of
          Level 2, despite some similarities. The majority of said similarities
          exist in isolated sectors of Level 3, not universally applicable to
          the level. Nevertheless, both levels are often depicted as having
          thin, attenuated hallways.
        </p>
        <p>
          As aforementioned, the walls and ceilings of Level 3 are lined with
          piping. These pipes vary in size and inventory; some are empty, whilst
          some are filled with fluids that resemble either water, almond water,
          or petrol. Neither of these, especially the latter, are safe to
          consume. In rare instances, the pipes of Level 3 contain articulate
          wiring, which does not appear to serve any purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Varying types of machinery can be found throughout Level 3, but the
          majority of these archetypes power an unknown location, seemingly
          outside of the level; others seem to control and power the pipes.
          Often, exposed wires emerge from the ceiling, walls, and floors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In relatively desolate, rare locations in Level 3, dimly lit hallways
          may be found; as is common throughout most of the level, the lights
          are relatively quiet, though they seem to be even quieter in these
          locations. Whilst these hallways may appear eerie to wanderers, there
          are no accounts of entity attacks, nor any harm being delivered to
          wanderers in these locations. Many wanderers have reported that these
          rare spots have soothing effects on all who enter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Metallic bars can also be found in Level 3, serving no known purpose.
          Attempts to break through these have been in vain, and they seem to be
          an unbreakable barrier. In many cases, as pictured, windows lie beyond
          these bars. Whether or not these particular windows offer any form of
          exit or anomaly is unknown, as the majority of them are inaccessible,
          rarely being found anywhere else in the level. All attempts of
          exploration beyond these bars have been in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          As is pictured, strange machinery can be found in Level 3, in rare
          rooms that seem to follow a common, repeating pattern; they seem to be
          located in a straight line from one another. The true nature of this,
          however, is unconfirmed, due to the non-euclidean properties of Level
          3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many have theorized that these strange rooms present in Level 3 are
          used to connect the level, and perhaps power it — some have gone as
          far to claim that the machinery and wires present on Level 3 power the
          Backrooms at large, or at the very least, the Main Nine. This claim
          has been widely disputed, though it has not yet been disproven. It is
          highly feasible that Level 3, the Electrical Station, works as just
          that; a station used to power the Backrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          As aforementioned, windows present behind the strange, indestructible
          prison bars found on Level 3 are inaccessible; nevertheless, windows
          are often found in locations which do not contain the bar phenomenon.
          These locations and Windows differ drastically in comparison to those
          found behind bars, in several ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          These windows appear to emit much less light; whilst those behind bars
          emit light similar to that of a sunny day, these illuminate
          considerably less — comparable to a cloudy day, or just before sunset.
        </p>
        <p>
          These windows are, notably, accessible; they are not able to be
          broken, but are able to be looked out of. The majority of these
          windows look out to nothing; only greyish clouds are visible, with no
          ground being seen below. It is unknown whether or not this reflects
          the true topography of Level 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rooms containing windows are typically well-lit and in close proximity
          of one another; these clusters of rooms are where most human activity
          takes place; whilst not the most forgiving places to live and coexist,
          they are among the safest locations in Level 3, which contains a
          relatively moderate number of entities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In rooms and clusters containing windows, it is common for pipes and
          wires to group together near the top of the walls, much more than they
          do outside of these rooms. Rarely, when a wire remains unmaintained,
          direct contact with said wire could cause temporary paralysis.
          Alternatively, direct contact could also cause uncontrollable
          movement; the reasons for these effects, presumed to be caused by
          electrical discharges, are unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rarely, white signs can be found throughout Level 3; one number,
          usually three digits, can be read. Below this number is cryptic text;
          all attempts to decipher said text have been in vain. When the
          aforementioned repeating pattern of rooms in Level 3 is followed,
          these signs may appear in each room, increasing in numerical order.
          They commonly end at 999; they practically reset, reverting to 1 in
          the next room. Among the earliest M.E.G written accounts of these
          signs is listed below — written in an S.R's diary in 2006, said
          researcher was attempting to decipher the strange, cryptic text — to
          no avail. Intriguingly, many statements made by this researcher do not
          match up with modern accounts of text found on the walls of Level 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          “ “We're finally finished investigating for the day... or whatever
          you'd like to call the former half of this strange, purely ocular
          day-night cycle. We've found several rooms, and they seem to all be
          connected, like a square pattern. I don't know why they're there, but
          I have been immensely intrigued with my findings. Signs are scattered
          throughout these rooms, and at the very top, there's a number. These
          usually increase as we traverse the strange, apparatus-filled rooms.
          The numbers don't seem to serve that much of a purpose, as we were
          told they tend to reset around a thousand. Somehow, none of my
          colleagues took note of the text below these numbers. It's...
          unreadable. Every now and then, there are readable letters. Once, even
          a word. But all of the text... it's all so random, lining up with
          nothing... Whilst we traversed throughout these rooms, I took note of
          the one legible word I could read. 'Contrivance.'”
        </p>

        <p>
          The "day-night cycle" of Level 3 works extremely strangely. Whilst
          there are visible changes in the illumination of the level as said
          cycle passes, such as the clouds outside of the level darkening before
          eventually dissipating, the majority of it is purely unperceivable,
          functioning whether or not the aforementioned illumination is visible.
          The cause for this is unknown, yet seems to be universal throughout
          Level 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          A multitude of Entities are present in Level 3, posing moderate harm
          to human inhabitants of the level. At any time interval, Entities tend
          to stay away from rooms containing Windows.
